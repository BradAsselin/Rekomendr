# Rekomendr — Session Log

The record of the "Taste memory that illuminates" phase (see `docs/BUILD_CHARTER.md`).
Every autonomous session appends exactly one entry at the end of this file, in the
format from charter §8. The log, not any assistant's memory, is the record. Truth
lives on disk.

Entry format:

```
## Session <N> — <slug> — <date> — branch auto/s<N>-<slug> — PR #<n>
SHIPPED: <one line per change, user terms first, file/mechanism second>
FOUND, NOT FIXED: <anything outside the fence, with the file and line>
BRAD MUST: <paste-blocks, decisions, dashboard steps — or "nothing">
NEXT SESSION SHOULD KNOW: <state, gotchas, anything the charter should be updated to say>
VALIDATION: <the "Brad's twenty minutes" checklist, verbatim>
```
